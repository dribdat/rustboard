It's our latest to-do Check it out!*\r\n\r\n\r\n# Hackathon Starter Kit\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to provide a baseline of understanding, steps to be taken, best practices and guidance on how to run a Hackathon. This project will contain information on how to run two types of Hackathons: \r\n\r\n## What is a hackathon?\r\n\r\n\"*Hacking*\" is most commonly used in the negative sense of an illegal act of computer crime to access resources which would otherwise be inaccessible. In the context of a hackathon though, the definition is one of the alternatives meaning to \"cut with rough or heavy blows\" (the act of intense focus on the project) or \"manage; cope; muddle through\". From a historical prospective, a \"hacker\" was one who's motives were to build and create, and a \"cracker\" was someone motivated by destruction or theft - read more here.\r\n\r\nAt its core, a hackathon is a short-burst event in which individuals typically form teams to intensively collaborate on projects which are designed around the problem statement or ideas provided by the hackathon organizers.\r\n\r\nA hackathon is underpinned and identified by these core tenants:\r\n\r\n- Creative problem solving. While there are no laws or rules a hackathon must include a technological (software, etc.) component, it most often does. If it doesn't include a technology component, it is usually more akin to a brainstorming session.\r\n- A gathering of individuals working together, attempting to solve a common problem or set of problems. Yes, you could be a HACKATHON TEAM of one, but given the short duration of most hackathons and the complexity of problems to be solved in the world today, diverse teams are almost always going to be more effective in creating solutions to a problem.\r\n\r\nHere are some things we think that are critical to running a hackathon: \r\n\r\n  - [Types of Hackathons](https://github.com/microsoft/hackathon-starter-kit/blob/main/MORE.md#types-of-hackathons)\r\n  - [Why run a hackathon](https://github.com/microsoft/hackathon-starter-kit/blob/main/MORE.md#why-run-a-hackathons)\r\n  - [Defining Problem Statements](https://github.com/microsoft/hackathon-starter-kit/blob/main/MORE.md#problem-types-and-categories)\r\n  - [Defining Roles](https://github.com/microsoft/hackathon-starter-kit/blob/main/MORE.md#roles)\r\n  - [Defining Success Criteria](https://github.com/microsoft/hackathon-starter-kit/blob/main/MORE.md#defining-success)\r\n  - [Recommending Open Source Approach](https://github.com/microsoft/hackathon-starter-kit/blob/main/MORE.md#open-source)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.

The file system is: `/api/1.0/YEAR/MONTH.json`.\r\n\r\nThe API is public, so feel free to use it for your own projects. As always, a link back to Hackalist is appreciated!\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nHackalist is made possible by dozens of contributors who add hackathon listings to our JSON database. The project accepts hackathons from all around the world as long as they are open to a general populace (hackathons restricted to college students, high schoolers, or large geographic areas are great; hackathons restricted to specific companies, colleges, or cities are too narrow to be listed).\r\n\r\nWe encourage anyone to create [Pull Requests](http://github.com/Hackalist/Hackalist.github.io/pulls) to submit their favorite hackathons, as well as hackathons they find through search engines and other hackathon directories (such as [Major League Hacking's listings](https://mlh.io/)). If you don't want to make a Pull Request, you may open an [Issue](https://github.com/Hackalist/Hackalist.github.io/issues) to request the addition of a particular hackathon.\r\n\r\nHackathon listings are sorted chronology based on the starting date of the hackathon. If two hackathons start on the same day, they are sorted alphabetically.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure your JSON syntax is correct before submitting. An easy way to check your JSON synax is through [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/).\r\n\r\n## JSON Parameters\r\n* `title`: Name of hackathon\r\n* `url:` Official URL\r\n* `startDate:` Starting date, formatted as *Month Day* (e.g. August 30)\r\n* `endDate:` End date, formatted as *Month Day* (e.g. August 30)\r\n* `year:` Year\r\n* `city:` City hackathon is occuring in, formatted as *City, State/Province Abbreviation, Country* (e.g. Miami, FL, United States). If a hackathon has multiple locations (e.g. CodeDay), list as *Various Locations (Country)*, replacing *Country* with a country name (or *Worldwide*).\r\n* `host:` The host (university, company, etc.)\r\n* `length:` Length in hours\r\n* `size:` Number of attendees; if not known, specify *unknown*\r\n* `travel:` Is travel reimbursed, in either part or full? *yes* | *no* | *unknown*\r\n* `prize:` Are prizes awarded to winners? *yes* | *no* | *unknown*\r\n* `highSchoolers:` Are high schoolers allowed to apply or attend? *yes* | *no* | *unknown*\r\n* `cost:` Cost of the event *free* | *$10* | *€10* | *etc.*\r\n* `facebookURL:` URL to official Facebook profile\r\n* `twitterURL:` URL to official Twitter profile\r\n* [DEPRECATED as of 10/16/2018] `googlePlusURL:` URL to official Google+ profile\r\n* `notes:` Any additional notes (limits to who can attend, special requirements, etc.)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nIf you want to test before submitting a pull request, you will need **Node.js** (12.x or higher)\r\n\r\nTo run the test, run `node path/to/repo/test.js` in the CLI inteface.\r\n\r\n## Listing Example\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"title\": \"Best Hackathon\",\r\n      \"url\": \"http://besthackathon.com/\",\r\n      \"startDate\": \"January 20\",\r\n      \"endDate\": \"January 21\",\r\n      \"year\": \"2016\",\r\n      \"city\": \"New York, NY, United States\",\r\n      \"host\": \"Best University\",\r\n      \"length\": \"36\",\r\n      \"size\": \"200\",\r\n      \"travel\": \"no\",\r\n      \"prize\": \"yes\",\r\n      \"highSchoolers\": \"unknown\",\r\n      \"cost\": \"free\",\r\n      \"facebookURL\": \"https://www.facebook.com/besthackathon\",\r\n      \"twitterURL\": \"https://twitter.com/besthackathon\",\r\n      \"googlePlusURL\": \"\",\r\n      \"notes\": \"\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n",

The Team tab allows users to create or join a team with other users.\r\n\r\n### Quill for Admins\r\n\r\nAdmins can view stats, look through applications, or edit settings from the Admin panel.\r\n\r\n#### Stats\r\n\r\n![Stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techx/quill/master/./docs/images/screenshots/stats.png)\r\n\r\nThe Stats tab summarizes useful registration statistics on the number of users in each stage of the process, demographic information, and miscellaneous event preferences like shirt sizes, dietary restrictions, or reimbursement requests.\r\n\r\n#### Users Table\r\n\r\n![Users table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techx/quill/master/./docs/images/screenshots/admin-users.png)\r\n\r\n*The Users tab displays a table of users where admins can:*\r\n\r\n1. Search for a user by name\r\n2. Quick-view user applications in a pop-up modal\r\n3. See a user’s application status (verified, submitted, admitted, and confirmed) at-a-glance\r\n4. See responses to other miscellaneous fields on the application\r\n5. Open and edit an individual application\r\n6. Admit users manually\r\n7. Mark users as checked-in at the event day-of\r\n\r\n#### Settings\r\n\r\n![Settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techx/quill/master/./docs/images/screenshots/settings.png)\r\n\r\nOn the Settings tab, admins can easily control their event application timeline by setting registration / confirmation deadlines. They can also write custom waitlist, acceptance, and confirmation copy that users will see on their dashboard throughout the application process. The custom copy is interpreted as Markdown, so HTML and images can be added.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n| Requirement                  | Version  |\r\n| ---------------------------- | -------- |\r\n| [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) | `10.13+` |\r\n| [MongoDB](www.mongodb.com/)  | `4.0+`   |\r\n\r\nRun the following commands to check the current installed versions:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnode -v\r\nmongo --version\r\n```\r\n\r\n*How to upgrade to latest releases:*\r\n\r\n- Node.js: \u003Chttps://nodejs.org/en/download/\u003E\r\n- MongoDB: \u003Chttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/\u003E\r\n\r\nAdditonally, there is an `.nvmrc` file in the root of the project. You can use [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to make sure you are using the right version of node for this and other projects! This also ensures that any cloud deployments of the project use the same version of Node.\r\n\r\nWe use `dotenv` to keep track of environment variables, so be sure to stop tracking the `.env` file in Git:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit update-index --assume-unchanged .env\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter doing this, fill in the environment variables in the `.env` before running Quill.\r\n\r\n### Local Deployment\r\n\r\n#### MongoDB\r\n\r\nIdeally, you should run MongoDB as a daemon with a secure configuration (with most linux distributions, you should be able to install it with your package manager, and it'll be set up as a daemon). Although not recommended for production, when running locally for development, you could do it like this\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir db\r\nmongod --dbpath db --bind_ip 127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### SMTP\r\n\r\nThis step is only required if you want to test the email-related functionality of Quill. The easiest option is to use the SMTP server provided by your personal email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). Look for the documentation about SMTP for your respective email and fill in the values in the `.env` accordingly. Be warned that sending many emails this way is not recommended and this method should only be used for testing. In particular, note that Gmail will require you to enable less secure apps in your security settings before Quill will be able to send email.\r\n\r\n#### Quill\r\n\r\nInstall the necessary dependencies:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnsure you have filled in the `.env` according to your setup, and then run the application:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngulp server\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Deploying for your hackathon\r\n\r\n#### MongoDB\r\n\r\nThe database can either be hosted with a cloud-hosted MongoDB provider, such as [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), or on your own server. Cloud-hosted MongoDB will generally be easier to set up and should be the preferred choice unless you are familiar with administering your own server. A guide to setting up Atlas can be found [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/). Note that the URI for the database (which must be specified in `.env`) will be different depending on where your database is hosted. If you use the \"Deploy the Heroku\" button in this document, a MongoDB instance will automatically be spawned via Heroku.\r\n\r\n#### SMTP\r\n\r\nA dedicated SMTP provider is absolutely required if you want Quill to work for your hackathon. There are several providers available such as [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) or [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com), both part of the GitHub Student Developer Pack. After setting this up, fill in the `.env` with the values that your provider gives you.\r\n\r\n#### Quill\r\n\r\nThere are also several options for hosting Quill itself. You can use Heroku by clicking the __Deploy to Heroku__ button above where, after making a Heroku account, you will be able to set the configuration variables and deploy Quill. A Dockerfile has also been provided to make it easy to run Quill in a Docker container either on your own server or with your preferred cloud service provider. Don't forget to publish the container's port `3000` to the host machine. If using the command line, this is done by using the `-p` flag and specifying which port on the host machine should redirect to port 3000 on the container.\r\n\r\n## Customizing for your event\r\n\r\n*_If you're using Quill for your event, please add yourself to this [list][users]. It takes less than a minute, but knowing that our software is helping real events keeps us going ♥_*\r\n\r\n### Copy\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to customize the text that users see on their dashboards, edit them at `client/src/constants.js`.\r\n\r\n### Branding / Assets\r\n\r\nCustomize the color scheme and hosted assets by editing `client/stylesheets/_custom.scss`. Don’t forget to use your own email banner, favicon, and logo (color/white) in the `assets/images/` folder as well!\r\n\r\n### Application questions\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the application questions, edit:\r\n\r\n- `client/views/application/`\r\n- `server/models/User.js`\r\n- `client/views/admin/user/` and `client/views/admin/users/` to render the updated form properly in the admin view\r\n\r\nIf you want stats for your new fields:\r\n\r\n- Recalculate them in `server/services/stats.js`\r\n- Display them on the admin panel by editing `client/views/admin/stats/`\r\n\r\n### Email Templates\r\n\r\nTo customize the verification and confirmation emails for your event, put your new email templates in `server/templates/` and edit `server/services/email.js`\r\n\r\n## CI/CD and Automation\r\n\r\n### Build and Test\r\n\r\n`.github/workflows/build.yml` contains a Github Action for building and running the project. The only test currently run is to check that a GET request of `/login` returns a status code `200`. This should be expanded in future with thorough unit testing. The Github action spawns a Docker instance of MongoDB for the application to connect to and utilizes the NodeJS version as specified in the `.nvmrc` file. *This action is run automatically on each push to any branch*.\r\n\r\n### Lint\r\n\r\n`.github/workflows/link.yml` contains a Github Action for linting the project. The action is currently using ESLint to achieve this with a *very* minimal ruleset (currently only checking for semi-colon rules). This should be modified to include an opinionated style checker such as [AirBnb's](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). *This action is run automatically on each push to any branch*.\r\n\r\n### Publish to Docker Hub\r\n\r\n`.github/workflows/dockerimage.yml` conatins a Github Action for building and publishing a Docker Image to the Docker Hub. The action takes the docker file at `.Dockerfile` and publishes it to the account specified in the Github Secrets. *This action is run automatically on each merge to the `master` branch*\r\n\r\n**[The following secrets need to be added to the repository](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets)**\r\n\r\n- DOCKER_USER =\u003E your docker hub username\r\n- DOCKER_PASS =\u003E your docker hub password*\r\n\r\n**[Using a Token rather than a password for this is probably a good idea.](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-hub-new-personal-access-tokens/)**\r\n\r\nThis will output an image in Docker Hub located at $DOCKER_USER/quill:latest\r\n\r\n### Automated Dependency Updates\r\n\r\nThe repository has been signed up to Dependabot, an automated dependency management tool. Dependabot automatically checks for updates for any outdated or insecure requirements and it will open a pull request for each one of them. To parametrize the tool further please [look here.](https://dependabot.com/docs/config-file/)\r\n\r\n### Notifications [on Push]\r\n\r\nThis project has been set up to run workflows that send notifications to a Discord server and a Slack workspace when changes are pushed. The secrets required to run these must be set by the admin according to the documentation of each implementation (configuration links). \r\n\r\n* `.yml` file information has already been added to the repository under `.github/workflows/notify.yml` and individual platforms may be removed by editing this file.\r\n\r\n##### Discord Notification\r\n[Configuring the action to send notifications to your organization's Discord server can be found here.](https://github.com/Ilshidur/action-discord)\r\n\r\n* Note that leaving `/github` at the end of the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` token (contrary to what the action recommends)  will use the default GitHub webhook settings in addition to sending this action's notification. We suggest leaving it if there is no webhook already configured.\r\n\r\n##### Slack Notification\r\n[Configuring the action to send notifications to your organization's Slack workspace can be found here.](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slack-notify)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Jest\r\n\r\nBasic Jest testing has been implemented in the `test.js` file. Currently the only test is to check that the `/login` page returns a HTTP 200 status code. These tests can be run using the `npm run test` command. More Jest tests including snapshots and unit tests should be added as features are created or updated. \r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\n\r\nTesting for accessibility is a great way to make sure that all hackathon enthusiasts can use Quill, regardless of ability. It's good practice to run accessibility tests on any changes that you've made to ensure that no new accessibility errors were introduced.\r\n\r\nAn accessibility testing tool, pa11y-ci, has been provided and configured for this project. To run pa11y-ci, make sure that Quill is running locally on http://localhost:3000/ (alternatively, you can change the URLs specified in `.pa11yci` to match those of your running instance). Then, run the command `npm run test:accessibility`. If several of the URLs checked by pa11y-ci produce the same number of errors, pa11y-ci may be having trouble logging in with the default admin credentials specified in `.env`. Check that your instance of Quill is running correctly, or change the credentials used in `.pa11yci`.\r\n\r\nIf your contribution adds any new pages to Quill, please add them to `.pa11yci` to make sure that these pages are covered by the accessibility tests. If your new pages are accessed as a non-logged-in user, add them at the beginning of the URL list. If they are accessed when logged in, add them after the URL with actions to log in.\r\n\r\nFor more information on pa11y-ci, please visit [pa11y-ci] and [pa11y], in particular the [section on actions][pa11y-actions].\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions to Quill are welcome and appreciated!

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).\n\n- [Dependencies](#dependencies)\n- [Production Environment](#production-environment)\n- [Development Environment](#development-environment)\n- [Project Structure](#project-structure)\n- [Database](#database)\n- [Conventions](#conventions)\n- [Creators](#creators)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe project uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing all dependencies. To install all necessary Node modules execute `yarn` from the root folder.\n\n## Production Environment\n\nThe app was manged with [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) for the Versus Virus hackathons, but can be run with any service that supports Node.js and PostgreSQL.\n\n## Development Environment\n\nThe app runs on the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It relies on [PostgreSQL 11](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and a mailserver like [Nodemailer App](https://nodemailer.com/app/). Note that the mail server needs to be available for sending a magic link for logging into the app.\n\nThe [package.json](./package.json) file contains all the commands for starting the application.\n\n### Local Environment Variables\n\nRename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and load it before running the dev command. For example:\n\n  npx env-cmd yarn dev\n\n### Local Database\n\nWhen you make changes in prisma/schema.prisma, you can create a migration by running `yarn prisma:migrate:save`. Apply it to your local db with `yarn prisma:migrate:up`.\n\nA database import is not necessary for development, as Prisma will create the necessary structure.\n\n### Testing\n\nTests are run using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). Simply execture `npx jest` from the command line to run.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nFor information on how the teams are created and how challenges are assigened, see the [Readme](./teamMatchMaking/Readme.md) file in the teamCreation folder.\n\n## Database\n\nA GraphQl tool is available on the endpoing `/api/graphql`. You will need to be logged into the application as an administrator in order to execute mutations. Typical queries can be found in the file [example-queries.graphql](./example-queries.graphql).\n\n## Conventions\n\n### Version Control\n\nThe working branch for production is \"master\". The titles of commits to master should be prefixed with a [semantic description](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) of the nature of the change. For example `fix:` or `feat:`. This will provide more meaning during the release process.\n\n### Code\n\nCode formatting is done with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). The build process may fail if the format is not followed well enough.\n\n## Creators\n\n(in alphabetical order)\n\n- [Dimitri Balidis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitri-balidis/)\n- [Daniel Isenegger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-isenegger-81a8876/)\n- [Tomáš Knápek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knapeto/)\n- [Norbert Kremer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/norbert-kremer-90a6b76b/)\n- [Gabriella Kovács](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriella-kov%C3%A1cs-95915310a/)\n- [Oleg Lavrovsky](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loleg/)\n- Michael Leu\n- [Karolos Potamianos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolos/)\n- [Gabor Raz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabor-raz-03b05686/)\n- [Claudio Romano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudio-romano-52181744/)\n- [Marco Wettstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-wettstein-b1b8938b/)\n- [Tomáš Witek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaswitek/)\n- [Nicolas Zanotti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-zanotti/)\n- [Remo Zumsteg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/remozumsteg/)\n",

          "autotext": "Hackfoldr\n===========\n\nOrganize gdoc and hackpad documents for hackathons.\n\n## Why?\n\nWe need a way to organize many dynamic documents before and during hackathon.\n\nThe shared folder feature in google docs comes very close to what we want, but as every document is opened in edit mode, it soon becomes unusable.  It is also impossible to sort the items and we had to use numeric prefix to achieve that.\n\nHackpad collections are great too, but we also want to include spreadsheets as one of the item types.\n\nSo we build this small single-page static web application that reads a list of url from an EtherCalc document, rendering it in a way similar to a google docs folder.  If the document supports read-only mode, we use that by default when it is opened by the user, and provide an additional edit link.\n\nFor example, with an index like http://ethercalc.org/g0v-hackath2n, you'll get http://hackfoldr.org/g0v-hackath2n/BfddbG2JBOi\n\n## Supported document types\n\n* Google Docs\n* Google Spreadsheets\n* Google Prensetation\n* Google Drawing\n* Hackpad\n* EtherCalc\n\n# Prerequisites\n[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) is required on your system.\n\nCheck it with the following commands:\n\n    $ npm -v\n    $ node -v\n\n# Install\n\n    $ npm i\n    $ npm start\n\nThen after the building message completes, connect to http://localhost:3333/.\n\n# Using Vagrant to develop\n\n[Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/why-vagrant/index.html) provides easy-to-configure, reproducible, and portable work environments. It will create a headless VirtualBox VM, then prepare the development environment and launch the server for you. You can then develop and test the code anywhere :).\n\nTo use Vagrant, you need to install:\n\n- Vagrant (\u003E= 1.6.x)\n- VirtualBox\n\nTo setup up work environment:\n\n    $ vagrant up\n\nIt will take several minutes for the first time, since it will have to configure its Ubuntu VM image. After the operation is finished, browse to `http://localhost:6987/` in your favorite browser. You are all set!\n\n`vagrant halt` if you need to shut down the Vagrant VM. For more information about Vagrant, see the [documentation of Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com).\n\nNote: Have to use older Vagrant (1.3.0+)? Change the `Vagrantfile`.\n\n# Google API key\n\nTo use the google APIs client to query YouTube Data API and check live status of Youtube videos, you need to apply your own Google API Key for browser applications at [https://code.google.com/apis/console#:access](https://code.google.com/apis/console#:access). After getting your API key, commit it into app/config.jsenv\n\n# Fork\n\n1. fork to your github account\n2. `$ git clone git@github.com/GITHUB_ACCOUNT/hackfoldr`\n3. `$ npm install`\n4. replace GITHUB_ACCOUNT, HACKFOLDR_ID, DOMAIN_NAME, GA_ID in gulpfile.ls\n5. `$ npm run fork`\n6. `$ npm run build`\n7. `$ ./deploy`\n\n# CC0 1.0 Universal\n\nTo the extent possible under law, Chia-liang Kao has waived all copyright\nand related or neighboring rights to hackfoldr.\n\nThis work is published from Taiwan.\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0\n",

It is akin to a Swiss Army Knife for event organizers: a website, guidelines, countdown clock, challenge board, project log, progress tracker, integrations with popular chat platforms, code repositories and open data APIs. The philosophy of this project, in a nutshell, is: **live and let live** (no tech religion, use whatever design / dev / doc tools you want as long as they are accessible to your team), **commit sustainably** (aggregate outputs in standard web of data formats for optimal search and archiving), **create in safe spaces** (embedded code of conduct, works offline, minimal privacy footprint).\r\n\r\nFor more background and references, see the [User Handbook](https://docs.dribdat.cc/usage/). If you need help or advice in setting up your event, or would like to contribute to the project: please get in touch via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat/issues) or [website](https://dribdat.cc). \r\n\r\n![Screenshot of dribdat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dribdat/dribdat/main/dribdat/static/img/screenshot_sandbox.png)\r\n\r\nFollow and support the project's development on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/dribdat/updates).\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href=\"https://opencollective.com/dribdat/donate\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"https://opencollective.com/dribdat/donate/button@2x.png?color=blue\" width=300 /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\r\n# Quickstart\r\n\r\nThis project can be deployed to any server capable of serving Python applications, and is set up for fast deployment using [Docker](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat/blob/main/docs/DEPLOY.md#with-docker). The first user that registers becomes an admin, so don't delay! \r\n\r\nIf you would like to run dribdat on any other cloud or local machine, there are additional instructions in the [Deployment guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/deploy/).
